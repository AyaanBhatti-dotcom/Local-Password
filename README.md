# Local-Password
This project demonstrates how to set up a **local password authentication system** on a Linux machine using **GPG** for encryption and **Pass** as a password manager.   It’s a hands-on lab that shows how to securely generate keys, store passwords, and manage them locally — no cloud needed.
